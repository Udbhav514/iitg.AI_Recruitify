# Model Exploration Hackathon: My Modeling Journey

For this hackathon, I experimented with a series of machine learning models to improve the accuracy of predictions. Here's a breakdown of my approach:

## Step 1: Linear Regression
I started with a **Linear Regression model**, analyzing features that best suited the dataset using scatter plots. Outlier analysis played a significant role in improving the model's accuracy. Despite these optimizations, the model's performance plateaued.

## Step 2: Polynomial Regression
Next, I extended Linear Regression to **Polynomial Regression (degree 2)**. This significantly enhanced the fitting of the data. However, further improvements were not achievable with my knowledge at the time (limited to Linear and Logistic Regression).

## Step 3: Exploring Advanced Models
After researching online, I experimented with:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**: Surprisingly, this did not improve the score.  
2. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:  
   - I was new to this model and learned about it from online resources.  
   - By tweaking its parameters and experimenting with the code, I achieved better accuracy than Linear Regression.  
   - This improvement pushed my ranking to 9â€“10, which was exciting and satisfying.

## Step 4: Neural Networks
Towards the end of the hackathon, I learned about **Neural Networks**. Although I had no prior knowledge, I researched the basics and implemented a simple neural network model. By carefully fine-tuning the network, I managed to achieve a noticeable improvement in my score.

## Reflections
This hackathon was a significant learning experience. It encouraged me to explore new models, understand their mechanics, and enhance my problem-solving skills under time constraints. From basic regression techniques to experimenting with neural networks, this journey helped me grow as a budding data scientist.
